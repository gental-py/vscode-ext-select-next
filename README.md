# vscode-go-to-next-character

Looking to 10x your navigation efficiency in VSCode? Drop that mouse and just press <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd> + <kbd>H</kbd> to move to the next character (or selected characters!). You can also quickly move your cursor to the next occurance of character(s) with <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd> + <kbd>G</kbd>

## Features

- Move your cursor to the next occurance of a character <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd> + <kbd>H</kbd>

For example if there is an image subfolder under your extension project workspace:

- Move your cursor to the character(s) with search <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd> + <kbd>G</kbd> (most useful imo)
